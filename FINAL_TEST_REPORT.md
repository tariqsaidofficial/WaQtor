- ✅ User → Campaigns Relationship

**Result:** All Sequelize relationships configured correctly.

---

### **Phase 8: Cascade Delete Tests (2/2)**
- ✅ Delete User
- ✅ Cascade Delete Verification

**Result:** Cascade deletes working as expected - all related data deleted when user is removed.

---

## 🔍 **What Was Tested:**

### **1. Authentication Flow:**
```javascript
POST /api/auth/register → ✅ User created with hashed password
POST /api/auth/login    → ✅ JWT token generated
GET  /api/auth/me       → ✅ User data retrieved with token
PUT  /api/auth/profile  → ✅ User data updated
```

### **2. Database Operations:**
```sql
-- Connection
✅ PostgreSQL connection established
✅ All 8 tables exist in database

-- CRUD Operations
✅ CREATE: Users, Sessions, Messages, Campaigns, Recipients, Groups
✅ READ: Query with relationships (includes)
✅ UPDATE: User profile updates
✅ DELETE: Cascade deletes working
```

### **3. Relationships:**
```
User (1:N) WhatsAppSession     ✅
User (1:N) Message              ✅
User (1:N) Campaign             ✅
User (1:N) Recipient            ✅
User (1:N) Group                ✅
Campaign (N:M) Recipient        ✅
Recipient (N:M) Group           ✅
```

### **4. Data Isolation:**
```
✅ Each user sees only their own data
✅ JWT token required for all operations
✅ User ownership validated on every request
✅ Cascade delete removes all user data
```
